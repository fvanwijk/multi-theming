# Multi theming

This is an example repo created for the blog post "Multi themed websites with TailwindCSS the easy way".

Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Then run `npm run dev:<color>` (color is red, blue or green) to run a local dev server with Vite for the chosen theme.

To build the app, run `npm run build:<color>` and to preview the built files in `dist/<color>` run `npm run preview:<color>`.
